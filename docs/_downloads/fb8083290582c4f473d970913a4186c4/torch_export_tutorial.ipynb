        "## Basic Usage\n\n``torch.export`` extracts single-graph representations from PyTorch programs\nby tracing the target function, given example inputs.\n``torch.export.export()`` is the main entry point for ``torch.export``.\n\nIn this tutorial, ``torch.export`` and ``torch.export.export()`` are practically synonymous,\nthough ``torch.export`` generally refers to the PyTorch 2.X export process, and ``torch.export.export()``\ngenerally refers to the actual function call.\n\nThe signature of ``torch.export.export()`` is:\n\n```python\nexport(\n    mod: torch.nn.Module,\n    args: Tuple[Any, ...],\n    kwargs: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None,\n    *,\n    dynamic_shapes: Optional[Dict[str, Dict[int, Dim]]] = None\n) -> ExportedProgram\n```\n``torch.export.export()`` traces the tensor computation graph from calling ``mod(*args, **kwargs)``\nand wraps it in an ``ExportedProgram``, which can be serialized or executed later with\ndifferent inputs. To execute the ``ExportedProgram`` we can call ``.module()``\non it to return a ``torch.nn.Module`` which is callable, just like the\noriginal program.\nWe will detail the ``dynamic_shapes`` argument later in the tutorial.\n\n"

        "## Data-dependent errors\n\nWhile trying to export models, you have may have encountered errors like \"Could not guard on data-dependent expression\", or Could not extract specialized integer from data-dependent expression\".\nThese errors exist because ``torch.export()`` compiles programs using FakeTensors, which symbolically represent their real tensor counterparts. While these have equivalent symbolic properties\n(e.g. sizes, strides, dtypes), they diverge in that FakeTensors do not contain any data values. While this avoids unnecessary memory usage and expensive computation, it does mean that export may be\nunable to out-of-the-box compile parts of user code where compilation relies on data values. In short, if the compiler requires a concrete, data-dependent value in order to proceed, it will error out,\ncomplaining that the value is not available.\n\nData-dependent values appear in many places, and common sources are calls like ``item()``, ``tolist()``, or ``torch.unbind()`` that extract scalar values from tensors.\nHow are these values represented in the exported program? In the [Constraints/Dynamic Shapes](https://tutorials.pytorch.kr/intermediate/torch_export_tutorial.html#constraints-dynamic-shapes)\nsection, we talked about allocating symbols to represent dynamic input dimensions.\nThe same happens here: we allocate symbols for every data-dependent value that appears in the program. The important distinction is that these are \"unbacked\" symbols,\nin contrast to the \"backed\" symbols allocated for input dimensions. The [\"backed/unbacked\"](https://pytorch.org/docs/main/export.programming_model.html#basics-of-symbolic-shapes)\nnomenclature refers to the presence/absence of a \"hint\" for the symbol: a concrete value backing the symbol, that can inform the compiler on how to proceed.\n\nIn the input shape symbol case (backed symbols), these hints are simply the sample input shapes provided, which explains why control-flow branching is determined by the sample input properties.\nFor data-dependent values, the symbols are taken from FakeTensor \"data\" during tracing, and so the compiler doesn't know the actual values (hints) that these symbols would take on.\n\nLet's see how these show up in exported programs:\n\n"

Unlike ``torch.compile()``, export requires full graph compilation, and we can't just graph break on this. Here are some basic options:\n\n1. Manual specialization: we could intervene by selecting the branch to trace, either by removing the control-flow code to contain only the specialized branch, or using ``torch.compiler.is_compiling()`` to guard what's traced at compile-time.\n2. ``torch.cond()``: we could rewrite the control-flow code to use ``torch.cond()`` so we don't specialize on a branch.\n\nWhile these options are valid, they have their pitfalls. Option 1 sometimes requires drastic, invasive rewrites of the model code to specialize, and ``torch.cond()`` is not a comprehensive system for handling data-dependent errors.\nAs we will see, there are data-dependent errors that do not involve control-flow.\n\nThe generally recommended approach is to start with ``torch._check()`` calls. While these give the impression of purely being assert statements, they are in fact a system of informing the compiler on properties of symbols.\nWhile a ``torch._check()`` call does act as an assertion at runtime, when traced at compile-time, the checked expression is sent to the symbolic shapes subsystem for reasoning, and any symbol properties that follow from the expression being true,\nare stored as symbol properties (provided it's smart enough to infer those properties). So even if unbacked symbols don't have hints, if we're able to communicate properties that are generally true for these symbols via\n``torch._check()`` calls, we can potentially bypass data-dependent guards without rewriting the offending model code.\n\nFor example in the model above, inserting ``torch._check(a >= 10)`` would tell the compiler that ``y + 2`` can always be returned, and ``torch._check(a == 4)`` tells it to return ``y * 5``.\nSee what happens when we re-export this model.\n\n"

Range refinement: calls that provide lower or upper bounds for symbols, like the above.\n3.
