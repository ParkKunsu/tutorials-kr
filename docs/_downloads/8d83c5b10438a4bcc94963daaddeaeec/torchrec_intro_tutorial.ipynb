        "### Embeddings\n\nWhen building recommendation systems, categorical features typically\nhave massive cardinality, posts, users, ads, and so on.\n\nIn order to represent these entities and model these relationships,\n**embeddings** are used. In machine learning, **embeddings are a vectors\nof real numbers in a high-dimensional space used to represent meaning in\ncomplex data like words, images, or users**.\n\n### Embeddings in RecSys\n\nNow you might wonder, how are these embeddings generated in the first\nplace? Well, embeddings are represented as individual rows in an\n**Embedding Table**, also referred to as embedding weights. The reason\nfor this is that embeddings or embedding table weights are trained just\nlike all of the other weights of the model via gradient descent!\n\nEmbedding tables are simply a large matrix for storing embeddings, with\ntwo dimensions (B, N), where:\n\n* B is the number of embeddings stored by the table\n* N is the number of dimensions per embedding (N-dimensional embedding).\n\nThe inputs to embedding tables represent embedding lookups to retrieve\nthe embedding for a specific index or row. In recommendation systems, such\nas those used in many large systems, unique IDs are not only used for\nspecific users, but also across entities like posts and ads to serve as\nlookup indices to respective embedding tables!\n\nEmbeddings are trained in RecSys through the following process:\n\n* **Input/lookup indices are fed into the model, as unique IDs**. IDs are\n  hashed to the total size of the embedding table to prevent issues when\n  the ID > number of rows\n\n* Embeddings are then retrieved and **pooled, such as taking the sum or\n  mean of the embeddings**. This is required as there can be a variable number of\n  embeddings per example while the model expects consistent shapes.\n\n* The **embeddings are used in conjunction with the rest of the model to\n  produce a prediction**, such as [Click-Through Rate\n  (CTR)](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2615875?hl=en)_\n  for an ad.\n\n* The loss is calculated with the prediction and the label\n  for an example, and **all weights of the model are updated through\n  gradient descent and backpropagation, including the embedding weights**\n  that were associated with the example.\n\nThese embeddings are crucial for representing categorical features, such\nas users, posts, and ads, in order to capture relationships and make\ngood recommendations. The [Deep learning recommendation\nmodel](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00091)_ (DLRM) paper talks more\nabout the technical details of using embedding tables in RecSys.\n\nThis tutorial introduces the concept of embeddings, showcase\nTorchRec specific modules and data types, and depict how distributed training\nworks with TorchRec.\n\n\n"

        "## TorchRec Features Overview\n\nIn the section above we've learned how to use embedding tables, one of the foundations of\nmodern recommendation systems! These tables represent entities and\nrelationships, such as users, pages, posts, etc. Given that these\nentities are always increasing, a **hash** function is typically applied\nto make sure the IDs are within the bounds of a certain embedding table.\nHowever, in order to represent a vast amount of entities and reduce hash\ncollisions, these tables can become quite massive (think about the number of ads\nfor example). In fact, these tables can become so massive that they\nwon't be able to fit on 1 GPU, even with 80G of memory.\n\nIn order to train models with massive embedding tables, sharding these\ntables across GPUs is required, which then introduces a whole new set of\nproblems and opportunities in parallelism and optimization. Luckily, we have\nthe TorchRec library <https://docs.pytorch.org/torchrec/overview.html>`__ that has encountered, consolidated, and addressed\nmany of these concerns. TorchRec serves as a **library that provides\nprimitives for large scale distributed embeddings**.\n\nNext, we will explore the major features of the TorchRec\nlibrary. We will start with ``torch.nn.Embedding`` and will extend that to\ncustom TorchRec modules, explore distributed training environment with\ngenerating a sharding plan for embeddings, look at inherent TorchRec\noptimizations, and extend the model to be ready for inference in C++.\nBelow is a quick outline of what this section consists of:\n\n* TorchRec Modules and Data Types\n* Distributed Training, Sharding, and Optimizations\n\nLet's begin with importing TorchRec:\n\n"

Now you\nmight ask, why create new data types to represent sparse features? To\nanswer that question, we must understand how sparse features are\nrepresented in code.\n\nSparse features are otherwise known as ``id_list_feature`` and\n``id_score_list_feature``, and are the **IDs** that will be used as\nindices to an embedding table to retrieve the embedding for that ID. To\ngive a very simple example, imagine a single sparse feature being Ads\nthat a user interacted with. The input itself would be a set of Ad IDs\nthat a user interacted with, and the embeddings retrieved would be a\nsemantic representation of those Ads. The tricky part of representing\nthese features in code is that in each input example, **the number of\nIDs is variable**. One day a user might have interacted with only one ad\nwhile the next day they interact with three.\n\nA simple representation is shown below, where we have a ``lengths``\ntensor denoting how many indices are in an example for a batch and a\n``values`` tensor containing the indices themselves.\n\n\n"

        "### Distributed Embeddings\n\nWe have already worked with the main TorchRec module:\n``EmbeddingBagCollection``. We have examined how it works along with how\ndata is represented in TorchRec. However, we have not yet explored one\nof the main parts of TorchRec, which is **distributed embeddings**.\n\nGPUs are the most popular choice for ML workloads by far today, as they\nare able to do magnitudes more floating point operations/s\n([FLOPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOPS)_) than CPU. However,\nGPUs come with the limitation of scarce fast memory (HBM which is\nanalogous to RAM for CPU), typically, ~10s of GBs.\n\nA RecSys model can contain embedding tables that far exceed the memory\nlimit for 1 GPU, hence the need for distribution of the embedding tables\nacross multiple GPUs, otherwise known as **model parallel**. On the\nother hand, **data parallel** is where the entire model is replicated on\neach GPU, which each GPU taking in a distinct batch of data for\ntraining, syncing gradients on the backwards pass.\n\nParts of the model that **require less compute but more memory\n(embeddings) are distributed with model parallel** while parts that\n**require more compute and less memory (dense layers, MLP, etc.) are\ndistributed with data parallel**.\n\n### Sharding\n\nIn order to distribute an embedding table, we split up the embedding\ntable into parts and place those parts onto different devices, also\nknown as \u201csharding\u201d.\n\nThere are many ways to shard embedding tables. The most common ways are:\n\n* Table-Wise: the table is placed entirely onto one device\n* Column-Wise: columns of embedding tables are sharded\n* Row-Wise: rows of embedding tables are sharded\n\n### Sharded Modules\n\nWhile all of this seems like a lot to deal with and implement, you're in\nluck. **TorchRec provides all the primitives for easy distributed\ntraining and inference**! In fact, TorchRec modules have two corresponding\nclasses for working with any TorchRec module in a distributed\nenvironment:\n\n* **The module sharder**: This class exposes a ``shard`` API\n  that handles sharding a TorchRec Module, producing a sharded module.\n  * For ``EmbeddingBagCollection``, the sharder is `EmbeddingBagCollectionSharder `\n* **Sharded module**: This class is a sharded variant of a TorchRec module.\n  It has the same input/output as a the regular TorchRec module, but much\n  more optimized and works in a distributed environment.\n  * For ``EmbeddingBagCollection``, the sharded variant is `ShardedEmbeddingBagCollection`\n\nEvery TorchRec module has an unsharded and sharded variant.\n\n* The unsharded version is meant to be prototyped and experimented with.\n* The sharded version is meant to be used in a distributed environment for\n  distributed training and inference.\n\nThe sharded versions of TorchRec modules, for example\n``EmbeddingBagCollection``, will handle everything that is needed for Model\nParallelism, such as communication between GPUs for distributing\nembeddings to the correct GPUs.\n\nRefresher of our ``EmbeddingBagCollection`` module\n\n"

For example, given\n2 embedding tables and 2 GPUs, you can:\n\n* Place 1 table on each GPU\n* Place both tables on a single GPU and no tables on the other\n* Place certain rows and columns on each GPU\n\nGiven all of these possibilities, we typically want a sharding\nconfiguration that is optimal for performance.\n\nThat is where the planner comes in. The planner is able to determine\ngiven the number of embedding tables and the number of GPUs, what is the optimal\nconfiguration. Turns out, this is incredibly difficult to do manually,\nwith tons of factors that engineers have to consider to ensure an\noptimal sharding plan. Luckily, TorchRec provides an auto planner when\nthe planner is used.\n\nThe TorchRec planner:\n\n* Assesses memory constraints of hardware\n* Estimates compute based on memory fetches as embedding lookups\n* Addresses data specific factors\n* Considers other hardware specifics like bandwidth to generate an optimal sharding plan\n\nIn order to take into consideration all these variables, The TorchRec\nplanner can take in [various amounts of data for embedding tables,\nconstraints, hardware information, and\ntopology](https://github.com/pytorch/torchrec/blob/main/torchrec/distributed/planner/planners.py#L147-L155)_\nto aid in generating the optimal sharding plan for a model, which is\nroutinely provided across stacks.\n\nTo learn more about sharding, see our [sharding\ntutorial](https://tutorials.pytorch.kr/advanced/sharding.html)_.\n\n\n"

        "### Adding in the Optimizer\n\nRemember that TorchRec modules are hyperoptimized for large scale\ndistributed training. An important optimization is in regards to the\noptimizer.\n\nTorchRec modules provide a seamless API to fuse the\nbackwards pass and optimize step in training, providing a significant\noptimization in performance and decreasing the memory used, alongside\ngranularity in assigning distinct optimizers to distinct model\nparameters.\n\n## Optimizer Classes\n\nTorchRec uses ``CombinedOptimizer``, which contains a collection of\n``KeyedOptimizers``. A ``CombinedOptimizer`` effectively makes it easy\nto handle multiple optimizers for various sub groups in the model. A\n``KeyedOptimizer`` extends the ``torch.optim.Optimizer`` and is\ninitialized through a dictionary of parameters exposes the parameters.\nEach ``TBE`` module in a ``EmbeddingBagCollection`` will have it's own\n``KeyedOptimizer`` which combines into one ``CombinedOptimizer``.\n\n## Fused optimizer in TorchRec\n\nUsing ``DistributedModelParallel``, the **optimizer is fused, which\nmeans that the optimizer update is done in the backward**. This is an\noptimization in TorchRec and FBGEMM, where the optimizer embedding\ngradients are not materialized and applied directly to the parameters.\nThis brings significant memory savings as embedding gradients are\ntypically size of the parameters themselves.\n\nYou can, however, choose to make the optimizer ``dense`` which does not\napply this optimization and let's you inspect the embedding gradients or\napply computations to it as you wish. A dense optimizer in this case\nwould be your [canonical PyTorch model training loop with\noptimizer.](https://tutorials.pytorch.kr/beginner/basics/optimization_tutorial.html)_\n\nOnce the optimizer is created through ``DistributedModelParallel``, you\nstill need to manage an optimizer for the other parameters not\nassociated with TorchRec embedding modules. To find the other\nparameters,\nuse ``in_backward_optimizer_filter(model.named_parameters())``.\nApply an optimizer to those parameters as you would a normal Torch\noptimizer and combine this and the ``model.fused_optimizer`` into one\n``CombinedOptimizer`` that you can use in your training loop to\n``zero_grad`` and ``step`` through.\n\n## Adding an Optimizer to ``EmbeddingBagCollection``\n\nWe will do this in two ways, which are equivalent, but give you options\ndepending on your preferences:\n\n1. Passing optimizer kwargs through ``fused_params`` in sharder.\n2. Through ``apply_optimizer_in_backward``, which converts the optimizer\n   parameters to ``fused_params`` to pass to the ``TBE`` in the ``EmbeddingBagCollection`` or ``EmbeddingCollection``.\n\n\n"
